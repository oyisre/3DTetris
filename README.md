# Grandmaster Tetris (3D Tetris)

### The beloved game of Tetris... in three dimensions
and then back to two dimensions

##### Playing
* From source:
  * Get [Open Turing](http://tristan.hume.ca/openturing/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Turing-Project/OpenTuring))
  * Clone the repo
  * Open main.t in Open Turing's editor
  * Find the run option
  * Use the run option
  * (Optional) Close the editor
* From executable:
  * Download the executable from releases
  * Alternatively, download Open Turing and select the option to create an executable after opening main.t\
   	(If the option isn't found, try downloading an older version of it)
  * Run it

Make sure you uncheck 'music', as the files are not included.\
The controls are shown in an on-screen window after you begin the game.\
The window displaying the current score (a number on a white screen) must be in focus in order to control the game.

The perspective looks fine if you just think of the coloured axis lines as the back of the game space.\
You can also think of the coloured axis lines as the front of the space as a fun hidden challenge for the eyes.\
